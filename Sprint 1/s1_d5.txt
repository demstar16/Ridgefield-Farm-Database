Map:
I had no idea of the paddock I worked on's name, however I distinctly 
remembered its location, right in the corner. Knowing this I could easily
view the map, see its location and find its name. Then I could filter the 
Data and search for data with that paddock name.

Log In:
As soon as I entered the website I was prompted with a log in or sign up 
option. I thought I had an account so I clicked log in, I soon realised I
didn't have an account. Luckily, there was a button at the bottom of the 
page that would take me to the sign up page. There I inputted my details 
and requested sign up. I got a prompt saying that my request has been
sent to admin and that I will receive an email when approved (or
disapproved.)

Forgot password:
I always remember my password, however I've managed to do the impossible 
and forget the password to see all the valuable farm data. Thankfully 
there was a link called "Forget Password?" That sent an email confirmation 
to give me temporary access to change my password.


Filter:
I had lots of data to go looking for, for some I knew what paddock I worked on, 
however some I didn't. I filtered all the data by paddock name for those that I 
could remember. As for the others, I just filtered the data from 2015-present and 
Manually searched for the rest.

Home Page:
Once my account was approved and I entered the site I could see a large table of data 
Ordered by year with most current at the top and a map of the farm to the side. There 
Was also a button under the map that gave me the option to make a new entry. It was good 
How the map and entry button remained in view as I scrolled the table.
