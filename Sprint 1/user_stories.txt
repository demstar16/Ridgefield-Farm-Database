Map:
I had no idea of the paddock I worked on's name, however I distinctly 
remembered its location, right in the corner. Knowing this I could easily
view the map and click on the paddock I worked on to see all the data for
that paddock and easily add my collected data to the pile.

Log In:
As soon as I entered the website I was prompted with a log in or sign up 
option. I thought I had an account so I clicked log in, I soon realised I
didn't have an account. Luckily, there was a button at the bottom of the 
page that would take me to the sign up page. There I inputted my details 
and requested sign up. I got a prompt saying that my request has been
sent to admin and that I will receive an email when approved (or
disapproved.)

Forgot password:
I always remember my password, however I've managed to do the impossible 
and forget the password to see all the valuable farm data. Thankfully 
there was a link called "Forget Password?" That sent an email confirmation 
to give me temporary access to change my password.

Navigation:
I entered this website in search for old data from the ages, back in 1968.
Thankfully all the data had a year, so I could simply filter the data by year.

***
Wanted_Data:
I was in search for yield data of a specific paddock. So I searched for most 
recent data for the desired paddock and checked the title of the attached 
file to see if yield was there... no luck. I'll have to gather my own data 
and make a new entry.

***
Search Functionality:
I wasn't entirely sure what I was looking for. To my surprise there was a 
list at the top of the screen showing all the types of data that can
be found in the database. Turns out I was after soil data for Paddock 6 and
8. So I simply searched for data with the following filters, paddock numbers 
6 & 8, year 2018-present. Then I searched the files for latest soil data

POTENTIAL FORMAT:
Paddock_Num, Paddock_Type, Year, FILE
