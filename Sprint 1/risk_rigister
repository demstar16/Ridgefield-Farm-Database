# Risks of the project
    the risk of for the change of scope could from various aspect. 

    * Scope and project management

    With development of the project, needs from client might change because each stakeholder has their own requirement. Some of needs might not be clear from client because quite often they do not know what they want. Therefore, we chose agile process for the project management. A major scope must be determined with discussion with client. And regular meetings between team and client to make sure the result meet the needs with some minor adjustment. 
    
    With the agile approach, the project will have less risk unmatched the client’s expectation. However, it could lead the workload to too much to complete within the scheduled time limit. The result with these sorts of issues to negotiate with client, make sure the scope of work is achievement within the project timeframe. 
 
    * Risk of initial plan and alternative solution

    * SharePoint 
    The initial solution of our project is to use Microsoft SharePoint, as UWA already have commercial license for this service and the project is UWA internal project. If the SharePoint is available for the project, it will provide enterprise level security for the database which is not achievable under current team size and level of professionalism.  On the one hand, team will come across less risk to expose to back-end challenge and focus on the other aspect of the project. On the other hand, the project will be less likely to suffer over the time constraint and unable to deliver an adequate project. 

    *Altenative solution
    Although the SharePoint is a favourable choice from the team, alternative solution is also needed in case the access of SharePoint cannot be granted. After the discussion, Django is the back-up plan for the back-end development as it is easy to implement. As the project decision will soon be finalise in this week, UWA IT team acknowledge us that SharePoint service is outsource to external and there are really limited modification that we can do to make it suit our requirement. Because we access risk of the SharePoint might not going to work and have alternative solution as a replacement the previous plan. Team can transact to alternative smoothly without affect on other part of the project.

    *Other risks

    Sickness – sickness of team member could influence on the process of the projector, especially due to current covid situation the risk relatively high. Depend whether on the ongoing task assigned to the team member is critical for the process of the project or not, other team members could help the task or extend the deadline of particular the task.

    Clash with exams, other assignments, and work – Clash of other units is most common risk for student project. Solution of avoiding this circumstance is to communicate with teammate, plan the project ahead to avoid happening.

    Challenging task – For team member facing challenging task that need to help with, seek for help from other team members as soon as you feel it is not able to resolve on you own. This could prevent the delay of the work deployed from individual.

    *Professional verification
    For issues is extreme critical for the project, verify from mentor could be a good choice to lower the risk of the project go wrong substantially. Based on the fact most of us have not much of experience of professional project, learning from mentor how to encounter problem effectively is important.
