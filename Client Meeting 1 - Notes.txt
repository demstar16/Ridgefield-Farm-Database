Client Meeting Summary

Client:
Debra Mullan - UWA Institute of Agriculture Business Manager

"Looking for a one-stop shop where any data from Ridgfield can be easily found"

User experience:
Create profile -> Log on -> Select year/heading -> Upload data.

About Ridgefield:
* Multitude of activities including research, commercial activities, student visits etc being undertaken
* Currently no way to access and share data from those activites - MAIN OBJECTIVE OF PROJECT
* Approximately 20 paddocks, can assume permanently fixed. But some projects may use multiple or fractions. Client no longer wants to sort by paddock.
* Approximately 30 Research projects annually or varying length.

Front end:
* Needs to be intuitive and user-friendly so people without much technological experience can use it.
* Upload process to be simple and quick so that people will actually use it. Needs to be easy access no matter what program/system.

Access Control:
* No access without an account.
* Users may be UWA staff/students or even outside the university. Accounts are to be vetted for approval by administrator.
* Currently looking at full database read access to anyone with an account. How will update/delete access be controlled?
* Accountability, logs, who accessed/modified/deleted what.
* 30 - 40 users currently but needs to allow for expansion, people come and go regularly.
* User profile and access will be maintained indefinitely.
* Will require an admin account. Features - monitor/change update/deletion, approve accounts, change account requirements.
* Users will be able to delete data but admin is notified/ can undo.

Data:
* Data is inconsistent and will come from an multitude of programs and potentially date back to 2009.
* Want a reasonable level of security. Data is not confidential but any personal info will be.
* Potential legal question relating to data ownership. At the moment checkbox to be implemented in upload process.
* Protections in place to limit accidental modification and deletion. New uploads must not interfere with existing data.
* Would like a backup system in place with backups dating back 6 months to a year.
* Data should be easily seachable to find certain items and individual files, examples given: paddock, livestock, commercial.
* Database should be encapsulated to allow data to be presented differently in future if required. Example given of interactive map.

Result of the meeting:
* Will research and present Debra with our implementation ideas at 12pm Wednesday next week.
