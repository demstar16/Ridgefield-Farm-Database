I believe a Relational Database would be best as most people in the group have some experience with relational databases (MySQL, Oracle, etc.) It also seems to be capable of what I'd think we'd need and from reading the brief project description. However, this will be confirmed when we meet with the client and make a plan. I have gathered some good information (straight from a website, link is at the bottom) that gives 2 potential databases we could use. Open to hear other thoughts or suggestions... :) 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MySQL:

Pros
- It's available for free.
- It offers a lot of functionality even for a free database engine.
- There are a variety of user interfaces that can be implemented.
- It can be made to work with other databases, including DB2 and Oracle.

Cons
- You may spend a lot of time and effort to get MySQL to do things that other systems do automatically, like create incremental backups.
- There is no built-in support for XML or OLAP.
- Support is available for the free version, but you'll need to pay for it.

MariaSQL:

Pros 
- The system is fast and stable.
- Progress bars let you know how a query is progressing.
- Extensible architecture and plugins allow you to customise the tool to match your needs.
- Encryption is available at network, server and application levels.

Cons
- The engine is still fairly new, so there is no guarantee further updates and versions will be forthcoming.
- As with many other free database engines, you have to pay for support

The reasons I liked these 2, were that they seem to be relatively easy to use code wise, members of the team have experience with them, well documented (MySQL, not MariaSQL), cheap or free and both offer stability and a wide range of functionality.

FARM RIDGEFIELD

* Farm Manager - Tim Watts
* UWA Institute of Agriculture Business Manager - Debra Mullan

* Mobile reception at farm is unreliable (only Telstra has reception). May have limited/no access to internet?

* Farm was purchased by UWA in 2009

* 500 ha cropping program; 700 ha pasture program; 7000 animals; 400 ha ecological management; annual turnover about $500,000 (likely outdated)

* Best Practice Farming Systems Project (previously Future Farm 2050) - The UWA endeavor that takes place at the farm.

  "multidisciplinary research and innovation to deliver robust farming systems that are economically viable, environmentally credible and create tangible social benefits."

  Current plan in place for next 5 years focusing on 5 key priorities:
	- Mitigation of on-farm greenhouse gas emissions
	- Adaptations for the changing climate
	- Profitable, ethical production systems
	- Restoration of ecosystems and biodiversity
	- Education, community engagement and capacity building

  Various strategic objectives but most relevant is Research and Innovation, activities include:
	- Research projects in at least 4 agricultural disciplines
	- Eight Journals per annum from research based on UWA Farm Ridgefield
	- Five instances per annum of research based on UWA Farm Ridgefield being translated to farmers, researchers, community.

POTENTIAL QUESTIONS

What are the main goals to be achieved by the database? What are the areas that the database would offer inprovements in over the existing system?

How would you expect the database to function from a users perspective? from an administators perspective?

How diverse is the data? Will the attributes being measured need to be customisable?

How many paddocks are there? Can paddocks be combined or subdivided in the future?

How many research projects are there currently? How often do they change?

How many users will the database have?

How would access groups be divided, would they be user specified or controlled by an administrator?

How is data presently collected and stored? What software is currently being used? Will it be manually input or come from an application? Will the existing data need to be imported? 

Aside from being stored and accessed, how will the data be used, will it need to be manipulated or exported?

Will user data continue to be stored and accessible after research completion? How large is the data expected to become?

What sort of systems will the database be accessed from? Is there a reliable internet connection at Farm Ridgefield?

Terms

1.The Institute of Agriculture would like to develop a //database/central repository// to house data collected and allow it to be accessible by others.

A central repository is a collection of stored data from existing databases merged into one so that it may be shared, analyzed or updated throughout an organization. It is essentially created by integrating the data from all available sources. Having all information in a central location allows for the data to be easily organized, analyzed and secured.

2. Data may include soils data, cropping history, yield, weather and initial thoughts are that it could be accessible on a //paddock-by-paddock// basis.

In a new style of intensive farming developed in North America, a paddock is a small (perhaps 1 acre) temporary subdivision of a pasture made with electric fencing, which is intensely grazed for a day and then left to rest for perhaps 80 days or more.
